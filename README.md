## Simple Create, Read, Update, Delete in Native PHP

This code/program can Insert, Read, Update, and Delete Data to the database. This program is just to show that I know how to code in native PHP and use basic CRUD functions.

- The program does not include a UI design for front-end
- The program has just the basic functions of CRUD in native php

## How to use this program

- I used XAMPP in this program
- You can use the nativephp.sql file to export and create automatically a database and the table
- If the file exporting doesn't work just create database with name = "nativephp" then create a "user" table with columns id,name,hobby. 
- id is the primary key and auto increment, name and hobby is just varchar(length 255)
- When database and table is ready, you can now run the program.
